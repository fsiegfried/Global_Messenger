To set up the project take the following steps:

1) If using Recaptcha:
	1.1) Register for a recaptcha account here: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list (I used localhost for the site name)
	1.2) Put your settings into the web.config/AppSettings under recaptchaPublicKey and recaptchaPrivateKey
	1.3) Turn on recaptcha in web.config HasRecaptcha = true
	1.4) Amend your content security policy thus: (taken from https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq)

    script-src https://www.google.com/recaptcha/, https://www.gstatic.com/recaptcha/
    frame-src https://www.google.com/recaptcha/
    style-src 'unsafe-inline'

2) Enable mail to be sent
	2.1) Create a file Config/PrivateMailSettings.config with your values here:

	<network host="localhost" port="25" defaultCredentials="true" />

	2.2) Set in web.config HasEmailConfigured = true

3) If you deploy this into production make sure you remove the test users from the databaseInitializer

4) Apply the NoCache attribute to any controllers which have sensitive data

5) Search for TODO in code to see further actions which could be taken

Notes
---------------

In order to get the acceptance tests running on the CI server I have included the 32 bit version of GeckoDriver.exe in the project. If you use Firefox 64bit, you will need to replace this with the 64 bit version

Known Issues
------------

If you use the Argon2 hashing algorithm then it will make use of an unmanaged dll called libargon2.dll. This needs to be put in the path (e.g. C:/Windows/SysWOW64/) for any executing code (either the web application or a CI server running the Argon2 unit tests). If you find a way around this restriction using unmanaged code then please let me know.
